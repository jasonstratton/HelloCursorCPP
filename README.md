# HelloCursorCPP

This project was created by giving Cursor the following commands:

```
Create a new C++ hello world project ​

Build and run the project
```


Cursor generated main.cpp and the makefile and followed up with this:

## Summary of what happened:​

1. **Built the project**: The make command compiled main.cpp into an executable
called hello_world using g++ with C++17 standard and warning flags.​

2. **Ran the program**: The make run command executed the compiled program, which printed
"Hello, World!" to the console.​

## Project structure:​

* **main.cpp** - Your C++ source code​

* **Makefile** - Build configuration for easy compilation​

* **hello_world** - The compiled executable (created during build)​

## Available commands:​

* **make**= - Build the project​

* **make run** - Build and run the project​

* **make clean** - Remove the compiled executable​

Your C++ hello world project is now fully functional and ready for further development!​
